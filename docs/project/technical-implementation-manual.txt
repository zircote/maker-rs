Technical Implementation Manual: The MAKER Framework for Zero-Error Long-Horizon Execution

1. Architectural Foundation: Massively Decomposed Agentic Processes (MDAP)

The prevailing paradigm in AI scaling prioritizes "intelligence-heavy" monolithic models, assuming that increasing reasoning capabilities will eventually solve the reliability problem. However, for long-horizon processes (1M+ steps), even a 1% per-step error rate is catastrophic, ensuring a 100% failure rate for the full task. As a Principal Reliability Architect, you must recognize that MDAP represents the orthogonal direction to scaling (Ref: Figure 1). Instead of relying on raw model intelligence, we bridge the "execution gap" by shifting to "structure-heavy" decomposed processes.

1.1 Defining Maximal Agentic Decomposition (MAD)

Maximal Agentic Decomposition (MAD) requires the transition from multi-step agents to microagents assigned to a single subtask (m=1). Empirical evidence demonstrates that LLM performance deteriorates regardless of task complexity as the context-window burden grows. By enforcing m=1, we achieve Multi-Agent Advantage: a solution to long-range tasks unreachable by monolithic systems. This granularity limits the context to only the information required for a single, discrete step, maximizing per-step reliability (p) and allowing the use of smaller, cost-effective models.

1.2 The Micro-Role Mandate

We reject the use of human-level "expert" personas. Reliability in MDAP requires assigning agents "machine-like" tiny roles defined strictly by their subtask. An agent is treated as a deterministic function within a Language-Based Algorithm (LbA). This mandate exploits the machine-like nature of LLMs, providing the stable modular substrate required for the error correction protocols detailed in the following sections.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. First-to-Ahead-by-k Voting Protocols

Subtask-level voting is our primary defense against stochastic noise. Unlike "reflection" or "semantic density" checks, which often inherit the model's original biases, parallel voting is the linguistic equivalent of classical error correction in digital communication. This protocol ensures that the inherent nondeterminism of sampling from a probability distribution is mathematically mitigated.

2.1 Mathematical Logic of the Race: SPRT and Gambler's Ruin

The MAKER framework utilizes a First-to-ahead-by-k voting scheme (Algorithm 2). This is a generalization of the Gambler’s Ruin problem and is grounded in the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), which provides the theoretical basis for optimal decision-making between candidates.

The protocol logic involves the following variables:

* p (Success Probability): The probability of a single LLM call producing the correct action.
* 1 - p (or p_{alt}): The probability of an incorrect or alternative sample.
* k (The Margin): The lead required for one candidate to be declared the winner.

For the Towers of Hanoi implementation, exact matches for the move and next_state are required to count as a vote; for general tasks, semantic matching may be applied. The "race" continues until one candidate leads its closest rival by exactly k votes.

2.2 Determining k-min

Architects must calculate the minimum margin (k_{min}) required to meet a target success probability (t) for a task of s steps:

k_{min} = \lceil \frac{\ln(t^{-m/s}-1)}{\ln(\frac{1-p}{p})} \rceil

A key insight for scaling is that k grows logarithmically relative to s (\Theta(\ln s)). In our 20-disk (1,048,575 steps) experiment with gpt-4.1-mini, k_{min} was calculated as 3 or 4 to achieve a target reliability of t=0.95. This logarithmic growth ensures that achieving near-zero error at the million-step scale remains economically feasible.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Red-Flagging Protocols and Quality Assurance

In zero-error environments, red-flagging is a critical protocol to identify correlated pathological behaviors. In MAKER, discarding a sample is superior to "repairing" its format. Attempting to post-process a misformatted response masks underlying logical instability, which increases the risk of correlated errors in the voting pool.

3.1 High-Level Risk Indicators and Triggers

We monitor specific technical thresholds to trigger an immediate sample disposal.

Red Flag Type	Strategic Risk	Implementation Trigger
Response Length	Pathological reasoning/Confusion loops	Response > 700 tokens (for gpt-4.1-mini)
Formatting Errors	Unstable model state/Failure to parse	Any violation of move or next_state schema
Logic Loops	Self-destructive over-analysis	Detection of repetitive semantic content

3.2 Impact on Error Decorrelation

Red-flagging is essential to reduce "collisions" (where multiple samples share the same incorrect vote). Analysis shows that a "helpful" repairing parser actually increases risk by validating samples that are likely to be logically flawed. In contrast, a red-flagging parser ensures that errors remain purely stochastic and uncorrelated. This robust decorrelation is the prerequisite for the mathematical efficiency of the k-margin voting rule.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Economic Modeling and Model Selection Standards

The objective of MDAP architecture is to minimize the c/p (cost vs. per-step success) ratio. Before scaling, architects must perform an AALPs (Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives) to project costs.

4.1 Cost Scaling Laws

Systems with low decomposition (m > 1) suffer from exponential cost explosions due to vanishing probabilities of multi-step success. MAKER (m=1) transforms this into log-linear scaling.

Expected Cost of solving a full task (MAD): \mathbb{E}[\text{cost}; m=1] = \Theta(s \ln s)

4.2 Proprietary vs. Open-Source Selection (Ref: Figure 6b)

* gpt-4.1-mini: The optimal proprietary choice. It offers the best c/p efficiency (1.6/M tokens vs. low error rate).
* gpt-oss-20B: The leading open-source choice. While its projected cost is lowest (0.2/M tokens), its deployment is often limited by API unreliability at million-call scales.
* o3-mini: Despite higher reasoning capabilities, its cost-effectiveness in MDAP is lower. The voting protocol (k) makes the model's "intelligence premium" unnecessary; the system's structure handles the reliability that would otherwise require an expensive model.

5. Operational Deployment Workflow

5.1 Pre-Flight Calibration

1. Estimate p: Use a random subset of 10,000 steps to determine the model's inherent success rate.
2. Batch API Integration: Utilize asynchronous processing to collect calibration samples to minimize latency and cost.
3. Project k: Use the k_{min} formula to set the margin for the full task horizon.

5.2 The Execution Loop

The system executes a repeating four-step loop. Parallelized sampling allows the time cost to scale linearly (s) even as token cost scales log-linearly.

1. Prompting: Deliver the subtask with minimal context and the established strategy.
2. Parallel Sampling: Generate samples concurrently. Utilize Temperature 0 for the first sample and Temperature 0.1 for subsequent votes to ensure diversity.
3. Red-Flagging: Apply parsers to discard any sample exceeding 700 tokens or violating format.
4. Voting: Apply the First-to-ahead-by-k rule to select the official action.

5.3 Verification and State Transfer

For the chain to remain unbroken, agents must output both the move and the next_state. The system (not the model) uses this next_state to seed the environment for the subsequent agent. This ensures a "clean environment" and prevents the accumulation of state errors across the million-step horizon.

By implementing these standards, we transform LLM agents into a deterministic substrate for Linguistic Computing. The use of Language-Based Algorithms (LbAs) within the MAKER framework enables the execution of the most complex, long-horizon processes with the same rigor as classical digital computation.
